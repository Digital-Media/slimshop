 * The Class Checkout implements the final order.

 * In case your index.php doesn't work,
 * you can create dummy entries in onlineshop.cart with SessionID=1 for testing purpose.
 * See /src/onlineshop.sql for a insert command to create some.
 *
 * With the "Buy Now" button a order is finalized.
 * The entries in the table onlineshop.cart, that belong to the current session, are transfered to onlineshop.order_item.
 * An entry, that stands for the whole order, is created in onlineshop.orders.
 * One order in onlineshop.cart is connected via equal entries in the field onlineshop.cart.session_id.
 * On success a status message is set and all entries in onlineshop.cart are deleted.
